[Demo](https://benettviszokai.github.io/html-css-recap-elena-joy/) 

Another simple and fun project from Simo Edwin.

I bought Simo Edwin's 'The Creative HTML5 & CSS3 Course' a year ago, and I thought it would be a good idea to refresh some of the basic concepts and best practices of HTML & CSS. 

Simple, easy to understand, absolutely recommended!
